# Cortex Infographic

Assignments for this class revolve around creating an **infographic** illustrating the **anatomy** and **function** of human cortex.

Your infographic will take the form of a **cortical flatmap**, an image that is shaped just right so that it can be wrapped around a 3D model of a real human cortex.

### Getting started

1. Download one of the blank images from this directory (either `blank.png` or `blank+curv.png` â€” this latter one includes shading for cortical curvature, which make it easier to find some anatomical features).
2. Open the blank image in your favorite image editing software (e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape).
3. Draw some things!
4. Save your edited image as a new file, e.g. `my_infographic.png`.
5. Open the [3D viewer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/infographic_viewer/) in your web browser.
6. After the brain has finished loading, click the **"Choose File"** button (top left) and select your new image file.
7. Check out how it looks!
